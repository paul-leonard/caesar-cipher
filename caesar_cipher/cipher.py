'''
Required Features: 
- [ ] Create an encrypt function that takes in a plain text phrase and a numeric shift.
- [ ] the phrase will then be shifted that many letters.
- [ ] shifts that exceed 26 should wrap around
- [ ] shifts that push a letter out or range should wrap around

- [ ] Create a decrypt function that takes in encrypted text and numeric shift which will restore the encrypted text back to its original form when correct key is supplied.

- [ ] Create a crack function that will decode the cipher so that an encrypted message can be transformed into its original state WITHOUT access to the key.
- [ ] Devise a method for the computer to determine if code was broken with minimal human guidance.
